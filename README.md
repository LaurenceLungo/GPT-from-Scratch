# GPT-from-Scratch

An step-by-step derivation and implementation of the GPT architecture from scratch, following the original papers on GPT and the transformer model. This is both a personal exercise to deepen understanding and a guide for others to derive the GPT architecture from foundational principles.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch

## Usage

To get started, run the Jupyter notebook titled `derive-gpt-from-scratch.ipynb`.
